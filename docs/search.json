    "section": "",
    "text": "My Experience with GenAI\nMy experience with GenAI has been quite positive. I have found it to be a valuable tool for enhancing my learning and productivity. The ability to generate text, code, and even images has opened up new possibilities for me in my studies and projects.\n\n\nMy opinion on GenAI\nI beleive that GenAI has become a crutch for me in my learning. I feel like I am a prompter for the AI and I have not been properly learning the material. I know in theory how to do things but often fall back on IA to do things for me. I am unable to properly wihtout needing an external reference or help, even if the task is relatively simple. I feel less confident in my abilities and knowledge because of how much I rely on GenAI. I am trying to find a correct balance of GenAI and self-learning. I think that GenAI is a great tool when used properly but often time people over rely on it."
